##Game Description
Tak is a board game taken out of the KingKiller Chronicles and made into reality. Our project will be a terminal implementation of Tak. It is a two player game that can be played on various different board sizes ranging from 3x3 to 8x8, although the most common is 5x5. Using the same rules, we will implement our project using player entered commands. The board will be reprinted after each update. Similar to a chess or checkers game implementation, players will enter different commands and use a grid to identify spaces on a board. The first person to create a “road” with their “stones” between two opposite sides of the board wins. Roads do not have to be in a straight line. Players will attack, capture and defend their own pieces.
